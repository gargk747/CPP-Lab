Assignment: 5

//To execute the OPENMP programs, we compile and run as given below :
//gargk747@gargk747-VirtualBox:~/Desktop/cpp$	 g++ 1.cpp -fopenmp -o 1
//gargk747@gargk747-VirtualBox:~/Desktop/cpp$	 ./1

//To execute MPI programs, we execute following: (mpic++ wrapper is used)
//gargk747@gargk747-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$   mpic++ 5.cpp -o 5
//gargk747@gargk747-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$   mpirun -np 5 ./5
